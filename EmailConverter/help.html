<br>The most common question is "What is this and how do I find it?"
<br>Shortly - it is an internet protocol that can access your mail box and then send or retrieve messages.
<br><b>To find it</b> open your email's "Options" or "Settings" and then look for "IMAP," "forwarding" or "mail servers." For example, to enable IMAP in Gmail, go to "Settings," select the "Forwarding and POP/IMAP" tab, scroll down to the IMAP Access section and select "Enable IMAP."
<br>You might also have to allow unauthorised application to access your e-mail.
<br><br><b>Fields</b>
